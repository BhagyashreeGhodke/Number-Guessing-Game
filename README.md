# Number-Guessing-Game
A number guessing game is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number between 0 and N in a maximum of 10 attempts . The game will end after 10 attempts and if the player failed to guess the number, and then he loses the game. I have created this game using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.
